# TacFootball — Pending Fixes

## Next Build

1. **Camera bias 70/30 upfield** — 70% of visible field shows what's ahead of the line of scrimmage, 30% behind. You want to see where you're going, not where you've been.
2. **DISMISS button right-aligned** — currently left-aligned (15.0 FIX 5). Move to right side, below announcer text.

## NOTES.md Cleanup (roll into next build)

- **Standing Instructions** still say "copy to ALL THREE" with desktop paths. Should just say copy to thumb drive.
- **File Inventory** still describes tacfoot4.html as "ALPHA 14.9". Should be current version.

## Future Features (next up after pending fixes)

- **Sound effects** — Web Audio API generated sounds (keeps single-file). Snap/hike, tackle thud, crowd cheer on big plays/TDs, whistle on play dead, buzz on sack/turnover. Trigger at existing play flow moments.

## Future Features (not scheduled)

- **Formation explainers** — plain English after each defense is announced. "4-3 Base — four big guys rushing your QB, three linebackers who can rush or cover, four DBs guarding your receivers."
- **Position fun facts in commentary** — Dan & Kiki occasionally drop a one-liner teaching a position or concept. "The tight end's a blocker who can catch — that's why the linebacker didn't expect the route." Sprinkled in, not every play.
- **Wider audible suggestions** — especially vs Nickel (currently only suggests 2 plays). Need 3-4 varied suggestions per defense.
- **Tendency counter** — defense adjusts to repeated plays
- **Look decay** — looking off safety works once per drive
- **Simplified decision flow** — 2-4 choices max
- **More Dan & Kiki lines** — 8 per category may not be enough
